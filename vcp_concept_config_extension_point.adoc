The NetApp Element Configuration extension point enables you to add and manage clusters, assign storage clusters to vCenter Servers for Linked Mode, and configure management node settings for QoSSIOC.

NOTE: Using NetApp Element Plug-in for VMware vCenter Server to manage cluster resources from other vCenter Servers using link:vcp_concept_linkedmode.html[vCenter Linked Mode] is limited to local storage clusters only.

NOTE: Your vSphere Web Client might differ slightly from what is shown in the following image depending on the version of vSphere installed.
