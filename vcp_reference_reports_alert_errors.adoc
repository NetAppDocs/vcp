The system reports error codes with each alert that help you determine what component of the system experienced the alert and why the alert was generated. You can view the error codes using the plug-in extension point:

* Beginning with Element vCenter plug-in 5.0, select *NetApp Remote Plugin > Management > Reporting > Alerts*.
* For Element vCenter plug-in 4.10 and earlier, select *NetApp Element Management > Reporting > Alerts*.

The following list outlines the different types of system alerts.
