The system reports error codes with each alert that help you determine what component of the system experienced the alert and why the alert was generated. You can view the error codes using the plug-in extension point:

* Beginning with Element Plug-in for vCenter Server 5.0, select *NetApp Remote Plugin > Management > Reporting > Alerts*.
* For Element Plug-in for vCenter Server 4.10 and earlier, select *NetApp Element Management > Reporting > Alerts*.

The following list outlines the different types of system alerts.

* *authenticationServiceFault*: The Authentication Service on one or more cluster nodes is not functioning as expected.
+
*To resolve*: Contact NetApp Support for assistance.
* *availableVirtualNetworkIPAddressesLow*: The number of virtual network addresses in the block of IP addresses is low.
+
*To resolve*: Add more IP addresses to the block of virtual network addresses.
* *blockClusterFull*: There is not enough free block storage space to support a single node loss. See the GetClusterFullThreshold API method for details on cluster fullness levels. This cluster fault indicates one of the following conditions:
** stage3Low (Warning): User-defined threshold was crossed. Adjust Cluster Full settings or add more nodes.
** stage4Critical (Error): There is not enough space to recover from a 1-node failure. Creation of volumes, snapshots, and clones is not allowed.
** stage5CompletelyConsumed (Critical)1; No writes or new iSCSI connections are allowed. Current iSCSI connections will be maintained. Writes will fail until more capacity is added to the cluster.

+
*To resolve*: Purge or delete volumes or add another storage node to the storage cluster.
* *blocksDegraded*:  Block data is no longer fully replicated due to a failure.

+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Severity
| Description
| Warning | Only two complete copies of the block data are accessible.
| Error | Only a single complete copy of the block data is accessible.
| Critical | No complete copies of the block data are accessible.
|===
+
NOTE: The warning status can only occur on a Triple Helix system.

+
*To resolve*: Restore any offline nodes or block services, or contact NetApp Support for assistance.
* *blockServiceTooFull*: A block service is using too much space.
+
*To resolve*: Add more provisioned capacity.
* *blockServiceUnhealthy*: A block service has been detected as unhealthy:
** Severity = Warning: No action is taken. This warning period will expire in cTimeUntilBSIsKilledMSec=330000 milliseconds.
** Severity = Error: The system is automatically decommissioning data and re-replicating its data to other healthy drives.
** Severity = Critical: There are failed block services on several nodes greater than or equal to the replication count (2 for double helix). Data is unavailable and bin syncing will not finish.

+
*To resolve*: Check for network connectivity issues and hardware errors. There will be other faults if specific hardware components have failed. The fault will clear when the block service is accessible or when the service has been decommissioned.
* *clockSkewExceedsFaultThreshold*: Time skew between the Cluster master and the node which is presenting a token exceeds the recommended threshold. Storage cluster cannot correct the time skew between the nodes automatically.
+
*To resolve*: Use NTP servers that are internal to your network, rather than the installation defaults. If you are using an internal NTP server, contact NetApp Support for assistance.
* *clusterCannotSync*: There is an out-of-space condition and data on the offline block storage drives cannot be synced to drives that are still active.
+
*To resolve*: Add more storage.
* *clusterFull*: There is no more free storage space in the storage cluster.
+
*To resolve*: Add more storage.
* *clusterIOPSAreOverProvisioned*: Cluster IOPS are over provisioned. The sum of all minimum QoS IOPS is greater than the expected IOPS of the cluster. Minimum QoS cannot be maintained for all volumes simultaneously.
+
*To resolve*: Lower the minimum QoS IOPS settings for volumes.
* *disableDriveSecurityFailed*: The cluster is not configured to enable drive security (Encryption at Rest), but at least one drive has drive security enabled, meaning that disabling drive security on those drives failed. This fault is logged with “Warning” severity.
+
*To resolve*: Check the fault details for the reason why drive security could not be disabled. Possible reasons are:

** The encryption key could not be acquired, investigate the problem with access to the key or the external key server.
** The disable operation failed on the drive, determine whether the wrong key could possibly have been acquired.

+
If neither of these are the reason for the fault, the drive might need to be replaced.
You can attempt to recover a drive that does not successfully disable security even when the correct authentication key is provided. To perform this operation, remove the drive(s) from the system by moving it to Available, perform a secure erase on the drive and move it back to Active.

* *disconnectedClusterPair*: A cluster pair is disconnected or configured incorrectly.
+
*To resolve*: Check network connectivity between the clusters.
* *disconnectedRemoteNode*: A remote node is either disconnected or configured incorrectly.
+
*To resolve*: Check network connectivity between the nodes.
* *disconnectedSnapMirrorEndpoint*: A remote SnapMirror endpoint is disconnected or configured incorrectly.
+
*To resolve*: Check network connectivity between the cluster and the remote SnapMirrorEndpoint.
* *driveAvailable*: One or more drives are available in the cluster. In general, all clusters should have all drives added and none in the available state. If this fault appears unexpectedly, contact NetApp Support.
+
*To resolve*: Add any available drives to the storage cluster.
* *driveFailed*: The cluster returns this fault when one or more drives have failed, indicating one of the following conditions:
** The drive manager cannot access the drive.
** The slice or block service has failed too many times, presumably because of drive read or write failures, and cannot restart.
** The drive is missing.
** The master service for the node is inaccessible (all drives in the node are considered missing/failed).
** The drive is locked and the authentication key for the drive cannot be acquired.
** The drive is locked and the unlock operation fails.

+
*To resolve*:
** Check network connectivity for the node.
** Replace the drive.
** Ensure that the authentication key is available.
* *driveHealthFault*: A drive has failed the SMART health check and as a result, the drive’s functions are diminished. There is a Critical severity level for this fault:
** Drive with serial: <serial number> in slot: <node slot><drive slot> has failed the SMART overall health check.

+
*To resolve*: Replace the drive.
* *driveWearFault*: A drive's remaining life has dropped below thresholds, but it is still functioning. There are two possible severity levels for this fault: Critical and Warning:
** Drive with serial: <serial number> in slot: <node slot><drive slot> has critical wear levels.
** Drive with serial: <serial number> in slot: <node slot><drive slot> has low wear reserves.

+
*To resolve*: To resolve this fault, replace the drive soon.
* *duplicateClusterMasterCandidates*: More than one storage cluster master candidate has been detected.
+
*To resolve*: Contact NetApp Support for assistance.
* *enableDriveSecurityFailed*: The cluster is configured to require drive security (Encryption at Rest), but drive security could not be enabled on at least one drive. This fault is logged with “Warning” severity.
+
*To resolve*: Check the fault details for the reason why drive security could not be enabled. Possible reasons are:
+
** The encryption key could not be acquired, investigate the problem with access to the key or the external key server.
** The enable operation failed on the drive, determine whether the wrong key could possibly have been acquired.

+
If neither of these are the reason for the fault, the drive might need to be replaced.

+
You can attempt to recover a drive that does not successfully enable security even when the correct authentication key is provided. To perform this operation, remove the drive(s) from the system by moving it to Available, perform a secure erase on the drive and move it back to Active.

* *ensembleDegraded*: Network connectivity or power has been lost to one or more of the ensemble nodes.
