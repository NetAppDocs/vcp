Beginning with NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server 5.0, the plug-in architecture changes from local to remote. With the introduction of the remote architecture, the plug-in is longer deployed inside a vCenter server. For Element Plug-in for vCenter Server 4.10 or earlier, the plug-in deployment remains local to the vCenter server to which it is registered.

This page describes the remote plug-in architecture and its implementation by NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server.

The vSphere Client remote plug-in architecture is designed to integrate plug-in functionality into the vSphere Client without having to run inside vCenter Server. The remote plug-in architecture supports plug-in isolation, enables scale-out of plug-ins that operate in large vSphere environments, and provides the following benefits:

* The plug-in is protected from interference by unstable or compromised plug-ins loaded on the same vSphere Client.
* Plug-in compatibility is robust across vCenter Server upgrades.
* An incompatible plug-in does not interfere with vCenter Server operation.
* You can deploy a number of plug-in versions within the same vSphere environment.
* The remote plug-in user interface only needs to communicate with a single back-end server.
* The topology of deployed plug-ins is well defined and easy to understand which supports troubleshooting.

== Communication paths within the remote plug-in architecture
This following diagram shows the communication paths between a plug-in, its user interface, and the vCenter Server to which the user interface is connected. The remote plug-in server is deployed on a management node along with management services which includes NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control.

|The remote plug-in identifier registers the plug-in manifest file with the vCenter Server Extension Manager by using the Web Services API.
|2 |A web browser downloads user interface elements of the vSphere Client from the `vsphere-ui` service in vCenter Server.
|3 |The `vsphere-ui` service downloads and parses the plug-in manifest file to determine where the plug-in extends the user interface.
|4 |The browser downloads user interface elements of the plug-in from the plug-in server which is deployed on the management node.
|5 |The plug-in user interface requests data from the plug-in server.
|6 |The plug-in server uses the Web Services API to interact with vCenter Server.

On the front end, the `vsphere-ui` service downloads and parses the plug-in manifest and serves the UI components to the browser, including references to the plug-in components, which are served by the plug-in server. These paths use simple HTTPS communications.

The back-end communication paths between the plug-in server, which is deployed on a management node, and the vCenter Server Web Services API use SOAP messages over HTTPS.

Using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control, the remote Element Plug-in is deployed in a docker container inside a management node along with management services.

The remote Element Plug-in vCenter Server, registration service, and storage I/O control (SIOC) service share the same docker service but listen on different ports.

== Remote Element Plug-in communication paths overview

You must first register the remote plug-in with the vCenter Server using the registration service running on management node (`https://<mnode-ip>:9443/`). On the registration page, you can see the vCenter server username, password, and the `plugin.json` manifest file path. 

NOTE: The default path is populated in the UI. No action is required.

If the details provided are correct, the registration service registers the plug-in with vCenter Server and enters the vCenter details in the plug-in server database.

After registration successfully completes, the plug-in server downloads the `plugin.json` manifest file and initiates the remote plug-in deployment which involves configuring the remote plugin as an extension with the `vsphere-ui` client. After the deployment completes, you can access the *NetApp Element Remote Plugin* extension point from the `vsphere-ui` web client.

All communication from the plug-in UI occurs through the vCenter Server which runs a reverse proxy service using HTTPS protocol that is responsible for forwarding the requests for the remote plug-in service. The plug-in server interacts with the SIOC service using HTTPS basic authentication and an Element cluster using the Element Java software development kit (SDK).
