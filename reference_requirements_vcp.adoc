[.lead]
Before you use NetApp Element Plug-in for VMware vCenter Server to manage your NetApp HCI or SolidFire all-flash array storage, you must verify that your system meets the requirements for plug-in use. 

For vCenter Servers 8.0 and 7.0, you can <<create_vcp_role,create a "VCProle" in vCenter>> for an Element plug-in user account and assign permissions to register or upgrade the Element Plug-in for vCenter Server and perform Element plug-in administration tasks.

== vSphere compatibility and best practices
Consider the following capabilities and recommendations before using the plugin:

* vCenter high availability (VCHA) is not supported.
* Because datastores are created using the highest VMFS version supported by the selected ESXi host, all cluster members should run the same version of vSphere and ESXi to avoid VMFS compatibility issues.
* The vSphere HTML5 Web Client and Flash Web Client have separate databases that cannot be combined. Clusters added in one client will not be visible in the other. If you intend to use both clients, add your clusters in both.

== NetApp Element support
The plug-in supports the following major versions:

* Element 12.x
* Element 11.x

== Network port requirements
You need to allow some TCP ports through your datacenter's edge firewall so that you can manage the system remotely and allow clients outside of your datacenter to connect to resources. For a comprehensive list of ports used in NetApp HCI and SolidFire systems, see this link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/hci/docs/hci_prereqs_required_network_ports.html[page].

== (Optional) Create a "VCProle" in vCenter
For vCenter Servers 8.0 and 7.0, you can create a "VCProle" in vCenter for an Element plug-in user account and assign permissions to register or upgrade the Element Plug-in for vCenter Server and perform Element plug-in administration tasks.

.Steps
