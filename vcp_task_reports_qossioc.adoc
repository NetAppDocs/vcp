[.lead]
You can view events related to QoSSIOC when a VM with a QoS-enabled datastore is reconfigured or issued a power or guest event.

You can view QoSSIOC events from the NetApp Element Configuration extension point in the NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server.

QoSSIOC events are displayed from locally added clusters. In a Linked Mode environment, log into the vSphere Web Client that has the cluster added locally to view QoSSIOC events for that cluster.

.What you'll need

* At least one cluster must be added and running.
* The QoSSIOC service must be configured and verified running using the QoSSIOC Settings page for the plug-in.
* At least one datastore must have QoSSIOC automation enabled.


.Steps

. From the vCenter Plug-in, select *NetApp Element Configuration*.
. Select *QoSSIOC Events*.

== QoSSIOC event data

* *Date*: The date and time of the QoSSIOC event.
* *Datastore Name*: The user-defined datastore name.
* *Cluster IP*: The IP address of the cluster containing the datastore from which the event originated.
* *Volume ID*: The system-generated ID for the associated volume.
* *Min IOPs*: The current minimum IOPS QoS setting of the volume.
* *Max IOPs*: The current maximum IOPS QoS setting of the volume.
* *Burst IOPs*: The current maximum burst QoS setting of the volume.
* *Burst Time*: The length of time a burst is allowed.
